### Project Title
US BikeShare Data

### Description
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

# 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

# 2 Popular stations and trip
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

# 3 Trip duration
* total travel time
* average travel time

# 4 User info
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
